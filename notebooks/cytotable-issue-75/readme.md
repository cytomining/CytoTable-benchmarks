# Exploring heap and resident memory with DuckDB and Apache Arrow

This folder is dedicated to exploring how heap and resident memory operate through DuckDB and Apache Arrow to better understand the implications of using data with these libraries.
The work originally was inspired by [CytoTable issue #75](https://github.com/cytomining/CytoTable/issues/75).
