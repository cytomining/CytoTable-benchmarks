# Exploring Python, NumPy, DuckDB, and Arrow floating point precision

This folder is dedicated to exploring how floating point number precision is captured within Python, NumPy, DuckDB, and Arrow to better understand the implications of storing data within these formats.
The work originally was inspired by [CytoTable issue #187](https://github.com/cytomining/CytoTable/issues/187).
